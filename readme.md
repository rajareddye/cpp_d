### Creational Design Patterns:
They deal with the process of object creation, trying to make it more flexible and efficient. It makes the system independent and how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

### Structural Design Patterns :
they focus on the composition of classes or objects to form larger, more complex structures. They help in organizing and managing relationships between objects to achieve greater flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in a software system.

### Behavioral Design Patterns :
they deal with the communication and interaction between objects and classes. They focus on how objects and classes collaborate and communicate to accomplish tasks and responsibilities.

#### **Singleton Pattern**:

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

#### **Factory Method Pattern**:

Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

#### **Abstract Factory Pattern**:

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

#### **Builder Pattern**:

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

#### **Adapter Pattern**:

Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a bridge between them.

#### **Decorator Pattern**:

Dynamically adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure.

#### **Observer Pattern**:

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

#### **Strategy Pattern**:

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

#### **Composite Pattern**:

Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

#### **Facade Pattern**:

- Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with that subsystem

Having a solid grasp of these design patterns will not only demonstrate your expertise in C++ but also showcase your ability to apply best practices in software development, which is highly valued in advanced job interviews.
